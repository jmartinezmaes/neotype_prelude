/**
 * Functionality for associative combination.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * ## Importing from this module
 *
 * This module exposes utilities for working with semigroups. It is recommended
 * to import them as they are named:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Semigroup, cmb } from "@neotype/prelude/cmb.js";
 * ```
 *
 * ## Implementing semigroups
 *
 * -   The {@link Semigroup:interface | `Semigroup<T>`} interface provides a
 *     contract for implementing [semigroups]. See the documentation for
 *     implementation patterns.
 * -   The {@link Semigroup:namespace | `Semigroup`} companion namespace
 *     provides the unique symbol required to implement its associated
 *     interface.

/**
 * An interface that provides evidence of a [semigroup].
 *
 * [semigroup]: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Semigroup.html
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * ## Properties
 *
 * Implementors of `Semigroup` must implement an operation that satisfies the
 * [associative property], such that:
 *
 * -   `cmb(x, cmb(y, z))` is equivalent to `cmb(cmb(x, y), z)`
 *
 * for all values `x`, `y`, and `z`.
 *
 * ## Implementing `Semigroup`
 *
 * `Semigroup` requires an implementation for `[Semigroup.cmb]`.
 *
 * The most common implementation strategies are writing classes and patching
 * existing prototypes. Implementation is implicit and does not require an
 * `implements` clause. TypeScript uses [structural subtyping] to determine
 * whether a value implements `Semigroup`.
 *
 * ### Conditional implementation
 *
 * Working with generic types requires additional consideration: in some cases,
 * a generic type implements `Semigroup` **only** when one or more of its
 * generic parameters implement `Semigroup`; in these cases, we must require a
 * `Semigroup` implementation from the parameter(s). In other cases, there are
 * no such requirements.
 *
 * ### Writing classes
 *
 * Classes and objects can implement `Semigroup`. This strategy works best for
 * types that:
 *
 * -   are already modeled using classes or objects.
 * -   provide direct access to their implementation.
 * -   have a single, specific behavior as a semigroup.
 *
 * Additionally, classes can easily wrap existing types to provide a variety of
 * `Semigroup` implementations. These "helper" classes are useful for types
 * that:
 *
 * -   have more than one behavior as a semigroup, or already have a default
 *     implementation for `Semigroup` but can have alternative implementations.
 * -   do not provide access to their implementation, and where patching the
 *     implementation is undesireable.
 *
 * ### Patching existing prototypes
 *
 * Existing types can be patched to implement `Semigroup`. This strategy works
 * well for types that:
 *
 * -   are built-in or imported from external modules.
 * -   do not provide access to their implementation.
 * -   have a single, specific behavior as a semigroup, or where the programmer
 *     wishes to implement a default behavior.
 *
 * Patching a type in TypeScript requires two steps:
 *
 * 1.  an [augmentation] for a module or the global scope that patches the
 *     type-level representation; and
 * 2.  a concrete implementation for `[Semigroup.cmb]`.
 *
 * The concrete implementation logic is similar to writing a method body for a
 * class or object, and the same practices apply when requiring generic type
 * parameters to implement `Semigroup`.

 *
 * ## Example implementations
 *
 * ### Non-generic implementation
 *
 * Consider a type that combines strings using concatenation:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Semigroup } from "@neotype/prelude/cmb.js";
 *
 * class Str {
 *     constructor(readonly val: string) {}
 *
 *     [Semigroup.cmb](that: Str): Str {
 *         return new Str(this.val + that.val);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Generic implementation with no `Semigroup` requirements
 *
 * Consider a type that combines arrays using concatenation:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Semigroup } from "@neotype/prelude/cmb.js";
 *
 * class Concat<out T> {
 *     constructor(readonly val: T[]) {}
 *
 *     [Semigroup.cmb](that: Concat<T>): Concat<T> {
 *         return new Concat([...this.val, ...that.val]);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Notice how `Concat` is generic, but there are no special requirements for
 * implementing `[Semigroup.cmb]`.
 *
 * ### Generic implementation with one `Semigroup` requirement
 *
 * Consider a type that combines promises by combining their results, which
 * requires that the results also implement `Semigroup`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Semigroup, cmb } from "@neotype/prelude/cmb.js";
 *
 * class Async<out T> {
 *     constructor(readonly val: Promise<T>) {}
 *
 *     [Semigroup.cmb]<T extends Semigroup<T>>(
 *         this: Async<T>,
 *         that: Async<T>,
 *     ): Async<T> {
 *         return new Async(
 *             this.val.then((lhs) => that.val.then((rhs) => cmb(lhs, rhs))),
 *         );
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Notice the extra syntax when implementing `[Semigroup.cmb]`. We introduce
 * a *method-scoped* generic parameter `T` and require that it has a `Semigroup`
 * implementation by writing `T extends Semigroup<T>` (the name `T` is
 * arbitrary).
 *
 * Then, we require that `this` and `that` are `Async<T>` where `T extends
 * Semigroup<T>`. This allows us to use `cmb` to implement our desired behavior.
 *
 * ### Generic implementation with multiple `Semigroup` requirements
 *
 * Consider a type that combines two values pairwise, which requires that each
 * value implement `Semigroup`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Semigroup, cmb } from "@neotype/prelude/cmb.js";
 *
 * class Pair<out A, out B> {
 *     constructor(readonly fst: A, readonly snd: B) {}
 *
 *     [Semigroup.cmb]<A extends Semigroup<A>, B extends Semigroup<B>>(
 *         this: Pair<A, B>,
 *         that: Pair<A, B>,
 *     ): Pair<A, B> {
 *         return new Pair(cmb(this.fst, that.fst), cmb(this.snd, that.snd));
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The syntax is similar to the `Async` implementation above. Notice there are
 * now two method-scoped generic parameters that are each required to implement
 * `Semigroup`.
 *
 * ### Non-generic augmentation
 *
 * Consider a global augmentation for the `String` prototype:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Semigroup } from "@neotype/prelude/cmb.js";
 *
 * declare global {
 *     interface String {
 *         [Semigroup.cmb](that: string): string
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * String.prototype[Semigroup.cmb] = function (that: string): string {
 *     return this + that;
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * ### Generic augmentation
 *
 * Consider a module augmentation for an externally defined `Pair` type:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Semigroup, cmb } from "@neotype/prelude/cmb.js";
 * import { Pair } from "path_to/pair.js";
 *
 * declare module "path_to/pair.js" {
 *     interface Pair<A, B> {
 *         [Semigroup.cmb]<A extends Semigroup<A>, B extends Semigroup<B>>(
 *             this: Pair<A, B>,
 *             that: Pair<A, B>,
 *         ): Pair<A, B>
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Pair.prototype[Semigroup.cmb] = function <
 *     A extends Semigroup<A>,
 *     B extends Semigroup<B>,
 * >(this: Pair<A, B>, that: Pair<A, B>): Pair<A, B> {
 *     return new Pair(cmb(this.fst, that.fst), cmb(this.snd, that.snd));
 * };
 * ```
